## Graph Representation

Each user-month is represented as a directed graph with a fixed topology:

**Nodes**
- Income, User, Savings, Goal
- Rent, Food, Transport, Utilities, Debt, Discretionary

**Edges**
- Income → User
- User → Expense categories
- User → Savings
- Savings → Goal (normalized progress)

Graph evolution is captured by changes in edge weights across months.

## Feature Engineering

For each edge, the following temporal features are extracted over an observation window (months 1–6):

- **Mean**: persistent financial pressure
- **Standard deviation**: volatility / instability
- **Trend**: direction of change over time

These features are interpretable, compact, and suitable for explainable modeling.

## Prediction and Explanation

An explainable baseline model (logistic regression) is trained to predict whether a user will reach their savings goal by month 12.

Predictions are explained by:
- identifying the most influential evolving edges
- showing how changes in specific relationships affect outcomes
- enabling counterfactual “what-if” analysis

## Interactive Demo

The Streamlit demo allows users to:
- select a user profile
- view financial graph snapshots (months 1 / 6 / 12)
- see predicted goal success probability
- inspect top explanation drivers
- simulate interventions (e.g., reducing rent or debt)
- receive habit-oriented suggestions and challenges
